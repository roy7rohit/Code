Still never stopped).\n- VLC would also never quit and it was impossible to close it in the KSysGuard System Monitor app, I had to kill i through the terminal.\n- All the stress of trying to fix bugs with VLC was causing stress, hair loss and the development of a heart problems.\n\n- mpv Media Player has none of these problems.\n- It plays any encoding, and has all the options and buttons you need in a lightweight easy to use interface. No extra BS options that you'll never ever use.\nIt just works!\n\nThank you!",

Couldn't find the process in task manager. Had to CTRL + ALT + TAB and logout then back in, and that resolved the issue.\nThere is no GUI method to change volume, can only mute, to change volume one has to use hotkeys.\n\nI would rate this -5 stars if I could!\n\nThe only reason I don't uninstall this is because it will then uninstall SMPlayer, which actually works.\nSkip this, just sudo apt install smplayer",
